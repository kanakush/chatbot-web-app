   ​🐳 Deployment with Docker
​This project is fully containerized. Docker ensures the application runs consistently regardless of the host OS, managing the Telegram Bot, FastAPI Dashboard, and SQLite Database in a single ecosystem.
​1. Prerequisites
​Docker and Docker Compose installed.
​A .env file containing your BOT_TOKEN and SECRET_KEY.
​2. Configuration Highlights
​Port Mapping: The internal FastAPI port 8000 is mapped to port 80 on your host. Access the dashboard via http://your-server-ip/ or http://localhost/.
​Data Persistence: The SQLite database is mounted as a host volume (./data.db). Your data remains safe even if the container is deleted or updated.
​Restart Policy: Configured to always, ensuring the bot automatically recovers from server reboots or unexpected crashes.
​🚀 Quick Start
​The easiest way to deploy the system is using Docker Compose:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/kanakush/chatbot-web-app.git
cd chatbot-web-app

2. Configure Environment:
Create a .env file in the root directory:
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
SECRET_KEY=your_secure_session_key

3. Launch:
docker-compose up -d --build
The Web Dashboard will be live at http://localhost.

Task Command
View Logs docker logs -f chatbot_system
Stop System docker-compose down
Restart/Apply Changes docker-compose up -d --build
Check Container Status docker ps

🔒 Security & Best Practices
Password Hashing: Secure verification logic prevents plain-text credential storage in the database.
Session Middleware: Encrypted client-side sessions for secure user tracking.
Input Sanitization: Strict Regex-based validation for all Telegram Bot inputs (Site ID, Phone).
Graceful Shutdown: The system properly handles signals to cancel background bot tasks and close DB connections cleanly.
